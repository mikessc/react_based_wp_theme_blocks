# Wordpress Theme - TBWA.com

The purpose of this repository... is to house the Wordpress Theme to be used in conjunction with the TBWA Blocks Plugin for the TBWA.com website. 

It's very difficult to write instructions that cover all developer situations. If you see anything here that can be improved, **please** let david.colquhoun@tbwa.com know. 

## Separation of Theme and Blocks

There are infinite ways to structure a Wordpress site. 

For tbwa.com the **theme** defines typography, page transitions, smooth scroll, parallax, analytics... the parts of the site that surround the blocks.  And have a **plugin** that defines many blocks.  All content is made up of blocks, including page structure and navigation.  

The blocks are separate from the theme, so in theory the theme can be changed without breaking the block content. If we switch the theme to Wordpress's default block theme, Twenty Twenty-Two all of the sites block content should function correctly.  

If we took a single block out of the TBWA Blocks Plugin, and moved it to another Wordpress site, that block is expected to function correctly as a standalone block. 

We have not created a separate plugin for each block because we expect there to be 60 to 80 custom blocks.  There will be additional plugins needed for specific functionality, like languages, or to minify/concatenate the enqueued scripts. 

## Wordpress environment
See the suggested Wordpress Development Environment here:
> https://github.com/DAN-AKL/wordpress-dev-env  

It uses Docker to very quickly spin up a database, a web server, and Wordpress. 

## Project folder
All of the theme files live within the themes folder inside Wordpress.
> tbwacom/wp-content/themes/tbwa-theme/

## Download the files
From inside the Wordpress themes folder, clone the repository into a new folder called ***tbwa-theme*** 
> cd wp-content/themes/  
> gh repo clone DAN-AKL/wordpress-tbwa-theme  tbwa-theme

You should now have this folder structure:
>tbwacom/wp-content/themes/tbwa-theme/  
>tbwacom/wp-content/themes/tbwa-theme/readme.md  
>tbwacom/wp-content/themes/tbwa-theme/parts  
>tbwacom/wp-content/themes/tbwa-theme/src  
>tbwacom/wp-content/themes/tbwa-theme/templates  
.. etc  

##  Node Package Manager (NPM)

From inside the theme folder:
>tbwacom/wp-content/themes/tbwa-theme/

Install dependencies described in package.json:
>npm install

Watch for changes to the source files:
>npm run start

Build once from source:
>npm run build

## Wordpress admin
Log into your Wordpress Admin and activate the theme from the Appearance \> Themes page. 
> http://localhost:8000/wp-admin
